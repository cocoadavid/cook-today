# CookToday - search over 360K+ recipes
*Please note that this project is in an early, development stage.*

My pet project, a React Application for searching recipes, using the API of spoonacular.com.
The general idea is to search recipes by ingredients you have at your disposal.

## demo
*The demo uses a free API that restricts the amount of API calls.*<br/>
You can take a look at the demo [here](http://cooktoday.herokuapp.com/).
